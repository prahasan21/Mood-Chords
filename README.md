# Mood-Chords
Machine learning based service deployed as a flask-based web application classifying songs as Happy/Sad and predicting its genre based on web-scraped lyric data. Implemented Word2vec (feature extraction), Linear SVC, Multilayer Perceptron, CNN, RNN, LSTM (predictive modeling) and manual feedback for wrongly predicted songs to re-train the model (dynamic learning).
